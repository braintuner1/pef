SECTION I. ABOUT THE ASSOCIATION 
Organization Profile: 
 
Pearl Edu Fund (PEF) is a student-led, non-profit initiative devoted to promoting equal 
access to education for children from underprivileged families, particularly those of 
school support staff. Our Education Support and Empowerment Initiative aims to reduce 
inequalities in educational access and empower young people with skills and 
mentorship opportunities. Education remains a cornerstone of national development. 
However, many children from low-income households, especially those whose parents 
work as non-teaching or support staff, face multiple challenges that limit their access to 
quality learning. These include the lack of scholastic materials, mentorship, and 
vocational training. 
 
Recognizing this gap, Pearl Edu Fund was founded in 2022 by students from St. Mary’s 
College Kisubi (SMACK), with the goal of mobilizing youth and communities to bridge 
these inequalities and empower learners to realize their potential. 
 

4 
 
Pearl Edu Fund (PEF) is operating under the theme of nurturing a generation of 
educated, empowered, and self-reliant young people. The initiative engages volunteers, 
students, and partners in school outreach, awareness campaigns, and resource 
mobilization for educational support programs. 
 
 
In the recent years of 2021 and 2022, there has been a growing number of children of 
non-teaching staff poised not to attend school at different levels due to lack of school fees 
resulting from low pay of their parents in most schools across Uganda. However, the 
growing concern of keeping the child in school for better communities and grooming 
responsible citizens is the key driver and reason as to why PEF-Uganda plans to expound 
its approach and strategy to finance access to quality education for millions of Ugandan 
children born to those that cannot afford the cost, with specific focus to non-teaching staff.  
 
 
 
 
Vision: 
To be the leading non-profit charity organization financing access to quality education 
for non-teaching staff children 
 
Mission: 
Our mission is to pursue excellence in providing quality education, bringing forth 
principled and improved livelihood for the children of non-teaching staffs. 
 
Values: 
Pearl Edu Fund Services Uganda attaches much importance and value to the way 
management and staff conduct themselves; and how they serve the clients. In its drive to 
excellent service, Pearl Edu Fund Services Uganda is guided by the following values; 
 
 
Integrity:  We demonstrate this by:  
 Treating people with courtesy and respect  
 Listening to what people have to say and responding helpfully  
 Giving people the opportunity to use and develop their talents  
 Valuing diversity.  
 
 

5 
 
Accountability We demonstrate this by:  
 Being honest  
 Being consistent both in what we do and say  
 Taking responsibility for our actions and decisions  
 
 
Collaboration We demonstrate this by:  
 Wishing to learn from and share with other people  
 Putting effective relationships at the heart of our work  
 
 Working towards common goals.  
 
 
Creativity We demonstrate this by:  
 Encouraging people to develop new ideas in an environment of trust  
 Being resourceful and innovative in our approach  
 Actively seeking and presenting the best in creativity.  
 
 
Professionalism We demonstrate this by:  
 Being true to our values and keeping our promises  
 Listening to and valuing the ideas and opinions of others  
 Accepting individual and collective responsibility for delivering work to a high 
standard 
 
Strategy: 
Our strategy is to focus on easing access to education financing and livelihood 
improvement through savings and investment. We continuously seek innovative ways to 
enhance capacity of the non-teaching staff in accumulating savings and investing 
qualitatively, improve the quality of our services as well as monitoring all aspects of our 
business scope and its quality performance while addressing the needs of all our key 
stake holders. 
 
SECTION II: PROPOSED IDEA/ SOLUTION 
 Background Information: 
Quite often certain groups of people who play a big role in the life and protection of 
children at school are forgotten. These people are never thanked for the good work and 

6 
 
service they do in helping and protecting children but rather abused, insulted, 
undermined, scorned and at worst brought to violence just for the smallest thing they have 
done. All this is done by either our parents or even their employers (the school head 
teachers and teachers at school). However, much as they try their level best to impress 
them by doing good, they will always look for the smallest bad things they have done. 
 This category of people includes; the cooks, security guards, wardens, matrons among 
others, who are always referred to as supportive or non-teaching staff. They undergo poor 
living conditions, they are in most cases undermined to the level that some are not paid 
and those who are paid, not in time or less.  In our opinion, these people are humans like 
us and have their families to take care of and we do believe that they should be paid in 
time because what they are doing is not because they want but they were pushed by 
different circumstances and conditions. 
Most times, even the little money they are paid, cannot sustain all their family and 
personal needs and in this case it is their children who suffer. They suffer in a way that 
they may not get all their basic needs in time most especially education. Different people, 
organizations, ministries and governments worldwide including us cannot agree with this 
anymore so have come up to give a helping hand. 
Worldwide, the UN (United Nations) also fights for the rights of social workers. This is 
under the different organs like The Human Rights Council and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner even the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural rights 
is part of this human rights in specific workers’ rights fight. In Africa, under the African 
Union is an organ called African commission human and people’s rights which fights for 
people’s rights. In Uganda, the human rights commission under the ministry of labor, 
gender and social development which fights for the rights of everyone in Uganda ranging 
from the young, youth, women, the labor force where people (non- teaching staffs) that 
we are striving to help belongs. 
 Rights of workers are not only fought in Uganda but also in different countries National 
Association for the Advancement of white people in South Africa, Ministry of Interior and 
Federalism and Ministry of National Security, women and human rights Development in 
Somalia. Different Individual organizations and NGO's have also embarked on the fight 

7 
 
for human rights for example Amnesty International Children's Defense Fund, Human 
Rights Action Center, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights without Frontiers Simon 
Wiesenthal Centre among others.  
As an organization, we want to differ so we looked for a different way of helping these 
workers especially the non-teaching staff. We are thinking since these people cannot take 
care of all their needs like medication, education for their children, we decided to help in 
the education of their children. We chose education so that these children can get their 
basic needs and enjoy normal life like others It will not only enable these children enjoy a 
normal life but also reduce on the level of illiteracy, levels of unemployment, poverty and 
also provide promote better living conditions for these children as they work hard towards 
pursing their intended career. 
Some of the children being helped are youths so then getting education will help promote 
morals reducing on levels of juvenile delinquency. The money these non- teaching staff 
would have used to take these children to school can be used to develop themselves. 
Looking through all these advantages, they all look forward to the development of our 
country, Uganda.  
According to the Education Statistical Abstract 2016, Uganda has 32729 non-teaching 
staff in secondary schools 61.4% males and 38.6% females. Making it males more than 
females by 22.8% complying that jobs in this sector are more adherable to males than 
females. The non-professional staff accounts the highest percentage (52.6%) followed by 
the pedagogical support (22.4%) and the rest administrative. 
This project is also coming up to help the country in pushing up to a middle income country 
where an individual is able to afford at least a dollar a day so as to even address the 
united nations sustainable development goals of zero hunger and quality education. 
Project description: 
We propose to develop a unique and more affordable means of supporting children of 
non-teaching staff. 
Problem Statement: 
Whereas many organizations like the Uganda Human Rights Commission, Uganda 
National Teachers Union, many have paid much attention to teaching staff and heads of 
institutions and majority of the non-teaching staff have remained voiceless yet they are 
also exposed to the financial challenges that everyone faces. 

8 
 
Gap: As of today, it is not clear whether children of non-teaching staff can access quality 
education at good or the would be best schools in the country due to low pay and high 
costs associated with access to education and financing options.  
 
Hook: The possibility of understanding if there exists some financing options to allow 
affordability of education on the side of non-teaching staff has to be addressed by friendly 
alternatives and this is what PEF-Uganda wishes to bring on board. 
 
Project Scope 
Objective: Our proposal is to identify the possible financing alternatives for children of 
non-teaching staff to access quality education.

                       SECTION III: IMPORTANCE OF PROJECT 
Importance of the Project to the Country 
The proposed project, holds significant importance for our country in several key areas: 
 
1. 
Educational Equity and Inclusivity: By providing targeted support to the 
children of non-teaching staff, the project addresses educational disparities that can 
hinder the academic success of these students. Ensuring that all children, regardless of 
their background, have access to quality education is crucial for fostering an inclusive 
educational environment and upholding the principles of equity and social justice. 
 
2. 
Long-Term Economic Growth: Education is a fundamental driver of 
economic development. By investing in the academic success of these children, the 
project helps to cultivate a skilled and knowledgeable workforce for the future. Educated 
individuals are more likely to contribute positively to the economy, drive innovation, and 
participate actively in the workforce, which in turn supports national economic growth 
and stability. 
 
3. 
Social Development and Cohesion: The project promotes social cohesion 
by strengthening the sense of community and support among non-teaching staff and 
their families. When families feel supported and valued, it enhances their overall well-
being and fosters a more cohesive society. This sense of community can lead to greater 
social stability and a more collaborative and supportive environment. 

12 
 
 
4. 
Improved Educational Outcomes: By providing resources such as tutoring, 
scholarships, and educational materials, the project directly impacts the quality of 
education that students receive. Improved educational outcomes for these children can 
lead to higher academic achievements, better career prospects, and a greater likelihood 
of pursuing higher education, all of which benefit the country as a whole. 
 
5. 
Role Modeling and Inspiration: Success stories arising from the project 
can serve as powerful examples of how support and resources can transform lives. 
These students may become role models within their communities, inspiring others to 
pursue educational goals and strive for excellence. This ripple effect can contribute to a 
culture of learning and aspiration that benefits society at large. 
 
6. 
Strengthening the Education System: The project contributes to the overall 
strengthening of the national education system by addressing gaps and promoting best 
practices in educational support. By demonstrating effective strategies for supporting 
underserved student populations, the project can inform and inspire similar initiatives 
across the country, leading to broader improvements in educational practices and 
policies. 
Importance of the Project to Families 
The proposed project carries significant importance for families, particularly those of 
non-teaching staff, in the following ways: 
 
1. 
Enhanced Academic Opportunities: By providing educational resources 
such as tutoring, scholarships, and learning materials, the project ensures that children 
of non-teaching staff have access to high-quality education. This support helps bridge 
the gap created by limited resources and enables students to perform better 
academically, leading to improved educational outcomes. 
 
2. 
Reduced Financial Burden: Education can be costly, and families of non-
teaching staff often face financial constraints. The project’s provision of scholarships 
and educational materials alleviates some of these financial pressures, making it easier 
for families to support their children’s academic pursuits without undue financial strain. 
 
3. 
Increased Parental Support: By offering educational support services, the 
project empowers parents to be more involved in their children’s education. When 
families receive support in the form of educational resources and guidance, they can 
better assist their children with their studies, leading to more effective learning and 
better academic results. 
 
4. 
Strengthened Family Well-being: When families know that their children 
are receiving the support they need to succeed academically, it enhances their overall 
sense of well-being and stability. This support can reduce stress and anxiety related to 

13 
 
their children’s education, contributing to a healthier and more supportive family 
environment. 
 
5. 
Greater Community Connection: The project fosters a sense of community 
among non-teaching staff and their families by demonstrating that their contributions are 
valued and that their children are being supported. This sense of belonging and 
recognition can strengthen family bonds and create a more cohesive and supportive 
community. 
 
6. 
Improved Future Prospects: By investing in the educational success of 
their children, families are investing in their future. Access to better education can lead 
to better career opportunities and higher earning potential for their children, which in 
turn benefits the family’s long-term financial stability and quality of life. 
 
7. 
Positive Role Models: The success of children who benefit from this 
project can serve as positive examples within their families and communities. When 
students excel academically and achieve their goals, they inspire their families and 
others to value education and pursue their own aspirations. 
Importance of the Project to the Community 
The proposed project holds significant value for the community in several key ways: 
 
1. 
Fostering Inclusivity and Equity: By targeting educational support for the 
children of non-teaching staff, the project promotes inclusivity and equity within the 
community. Ensuring that all children, regardless of their family background, have 
access to quality education helps to level the playing field and reduces educational 
disparities, contributing to a more equitable society. 
 
2. 
Strengthening Community Ties: The project fosters a sense of unity and 
solidarity within the community by supporting families who play a crucial role in the 
functioning of local institutions. By investing in the educational success of these 
families, the community demonstrates its commitment to supporting all members and 
reinforces social cohesion. 
 
3. 
Enhancing Local Development: Educated individuals contribute positively 
to local development and economic growth. By improving the educational outcomes for 
children, the project helps to build a more skilled and knowledgeable workforce, which 
can drive innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic progress within the community. 
 
4. 
Promoting Positive Role Models: Successful outcomes from the project 
create role models within the community. Children who benefit from enhanced 
educational support may inspire others to pursue educational and professional goals, 
fostering a culture of aspiration and achievement. 

14 
 
 
5. 
Building a Supportive Environment: The project encourages the creation 
of a supportive environment where community members are actively involved in each 
other’s success. This collaborative approach strengthens community bonds and creates 
a culture of mutual support and shared responsibility. 
 
6. 
Long-Term Community Benefits: Investing in education yields long-term 
benefits for the community. Educated individuals are more likely to engage in 
community activities, contribute to local initiatives, and make informed decisions that 
benefit the collective well-being of the community. 
 
7. 
Reducing Social Inequality: By addressing the educational needs of 
underrepresented groups, the project helps to reduce social inequality. It provides 
opportunities for all children regardless of socioeconomic background.

Rationale for Promoting Education for Non-Teaching Staff children 
 
1. 
Alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): 
Promoting education for the children of non-teaching staff directly supports the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4), which calls for ensuring inclusive 
and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all. The 
UN emphasizes the importance of leaving no one behind, and by focusing on the 
children of non-teaching staff, educational initiatives ensure that even those from more 
economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds have access to quality education. 
This reflects the core principles of equity, social justice, and universal access that are 
foundational to the UN’s global agenda (United Nations, 2015). 
 
2. 
Supporting Vulnerable Groups in Ugandan Society: 
Non-teaching staff in Ugandan schools often come from lower-income backgrounds, 
facing financial challenges that limit their children’s access to quality education. 
According to the Uganda National Development Plan (NDP III), one of the key 
objectives is to improve access to quality social services for all Ugandans, especially 
the vulnerable. Supporting the education of non-teaching staff children contributes to 
addressing this objective by breaking the cycle of poverty and fostering inclusive social 
and economic development (Government of Uganda, 2020). 
 
3. 
NGO Initiatives on Equity and Education: 
Numerous Ugandan NGOs are aligned with the mission to enhance educational access 
for disadvantaged groups. For example, organizations like the Uganda National NGO 
Forum and Save the Children Uganda have emphasized the need to ensure that 
children from all backgrounds, including those from low-income and vulnerable families, 
have access to education. By promoting educational opportunities for non-teaching 
staff’s children, these NGOs support the broader national goal of equity and inclusion in 
education (Uganda National NGO Forum, 2019). 

49 
 
 
4. 
Government Policies on Universal Education: 
The Ugandan government’s Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal 
Secondary Education (USE) programs are geared toward providing free education for 
all children. However, despite these efforts, children from low-income families, 
particularly non-teaching staff, often face additional challenges such as hidden costs, 
limited resources, and inadequate support. By promoting education for these children, 
initiatives align with government efforts while also filling gaps that may exist in access to 
quality resources (Ministry of Education and Sports, 2020). 
 
5. 
Fostering Inclusivity and Socioeconomic Growth: 
Investing in the education of non-teaching staff children is also critical for national 
economic growth and development. Research by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics 
(UBOS) indicates that improving education outcomes across all sectors of society leads 
to greater national productivity and poverty reduction. By ensuring that even the most 
marginalized children can access quality education, Uganda moves closer to achieving 
the socioeconomic goals outlined in its Vision 2040 framework, which aims to transform 
Uganda into a modern and prosperous country (UBOS, 2021). 
 
6. 
Human Rights and Social Justice: 
Education is recognized as a fundamental human right under the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights (Article 26) and various other international conventions to which 
Uganda is a signatory. Providing access to education for non-teaching staff children not 
only upholds this human right but also ensures social justice by leveling the playing field 
for all children, regardless of their family’s economic status or social role within the 
school system. 
7. Education for All (EFA) Framework – UNESCO (2000): 
The Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All (EFA) emphasizes ensuring that 
every child has access to basic education by the year 2015. While progress has been 
made globally, the principles of EFA remain relevant, particularly for marginalized 
groups, such as children from low-income families, which includes the children of non-
teaching staff. EFA stresses the need to create inclusive, equitable educational 
environments, aligning with Uganda’s efforts to ensure access to education for all 
children. 
 
• 
Key Point: EFA promotes access to quality education, especially for the 
most vulnerable and marginalized groups in society.

Commitments – Dakar Framework for Action. 2000.  
 
8. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) – UN (1989): 
The Convention on the Rights of the Child highlights the right of every child to access 
education (Article 28). Uganda, as a signatory to the CRC, has committed to ensuring 
that children receive free, compulsory primary education and to making secondary 
education accessible to all. Supporting the children of non-teaching staff through 
educational programs aligns with Uganda’s obligations under this convention, ensuring 
that all children, regardless of their family’s socioeconomic status, can benefit from 
quality education. 
 
• 
Key Point: Article 28 of the CRC underscores education as a right for 
every child, which the Ugandan government must uphold. 
 
• 
Reference: United Nations. Convention on the Rights of the Child. 1989. 
9. African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC) – African Union 
(1999): 
The ACRWC reinforces the right of every African child to education, with an emphasis 
on equal access and non-discrimination. It specifically mandates governments to 
eliminate disparities in access to education, ensuring that vulnerable and disadvantaged 
children are included. For Uganda, this means that programs supporting the children of 
non-teaching staff in accessing education contribute to fulfilling commitments under the 
charter. 
 
 
• 
Key Point: The ACRWC ensures that all children in Africa have the right to 
education, and it calls for proactive measures to reduce disparities. 
 
• 
Reference: African Union. African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of 
the Child. 1999.  
10. The Incheon Declaration – UNESCO (2015): 
The Incheon Declaration adopted at the World Education Forum outlines a vision for 
education by 2030, including commitments to provide inclusive and equitable quality 
education. It reaffirms that education is a public good and a fundamental human right. 
For Uganda, the principles of the Incheon Declaration call for programs that specifically 
address the needs of disadvantaged groups, including non-teaching staff’s children, by 
providing them with equal opportunities to pursue quality education. 

51 
 
 
• 
Key Point: The Incheon Declaration focuses on inclusive education for 
marginalized groups, emphasizing equity and lifelong learning for all.

Framework for Action. 2015.  
11. National Gender Policy – Government of Uganda (2007): 
Uganda’s National Gender Policy promotes gender equality in access to resources, 
services, and opportunities, including education. By supporting the children of non-
teaching staff, who may disproportionately be from low-income families and face 
challenges accessing education, the government’s educational programs uphold gender 
equity and social inclusion, as outlined in this policy. 
 
• 
Key Point: The National Gender Policy calls for inclusive education that 
addresses disparities faced by marginalized groups, ensuring equal opportunities for 
boys and girls alike.

Uganda National Gender Policy. Government of Uganda, 2007.  
12. Uganda’s Universal Primary and Secondary Education Policies (UPE and USE) – 
Government of Uganda (1997 & 2007): 
Uganda’s Universal Primary Education (UPE) and Universal Secondary Education 
(USE) policies ensure free access to primary and secondary education for all children. 
However, the children of non-teaching staff often face additional socioeconomic barriers 
to fully benefiting from these programs, such as hidden costs or limited access to 
resources. Supporting them aligns with the government’s goal of making education truly 
universal by addressing the gaps in access for vulnerable populations. 
 
• 
Key Point: UPE and USE policies aim to provide free education to all, but 
specific efforts must be made to support children from low-income families who face 
additional challenges. 
 
• 
Reference: Ministry of Education and Sports. Universal Primary Education 
and Universal Secondary Education Policies. Government of Uganda, 1997 & 2007.  
13. Uganda’s Vision 2040 – Government of Uganda (2013): 
Vision 2040 is Uganda’s long-term development plan, which envisions transforming 
Uganda into a modern and prosperous country by 2040. Education is a key pillar of this 
vision, with a focus on creating a skilled and knowledgeable workforce. Supporting the 
children of non-teaching staff aligns with this broader goal by ensuring that all children, 

52 
 
regardless of their socioeconomic status, receive the quality education necessary to 
contribute to Uganda’s development. 
 
• 
Key Point: Vision 2040 emphasizes the importance of inclusive education 
for national development, making education accessible to all sectors of society.

14. UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW) – UN (1979): 
Although focused on gender, the CEDAW convention emphasizes the need for equal 
access to education for both boys and girls. In the Ugandan context, many children of 
non-teaching staff may be girls who face additional challenges accessing education. By 
supporting these children, educational programs address gender disparities and fulfill 
Uganda’s commitments under CEDAW to ensure equal educational opportunities. 
 
•Key Point: CEDAW calls for the elimination of gender-based discrimination in 
education, ensuring equal opportunities for girls from marginalized families.
