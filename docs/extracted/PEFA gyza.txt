Zirobwe, Gayaza.
Dear Sir/ Madam,
          Re: REQUEST TO INTRODUCE PEFA CLUB AND PEF PROGRAMME

           I am writing to present a proposal for a project that we believe has the potential to make a significant and lasting impact on our community. Our initiative focused on supporting the educational attainment of children of non-teaching staff within our institution. This project is designed to provide these children with the necessary resources, guidance, and opportunities to excel academically, thereby uplifting not only the individuals involved but also their families, the broader community, and ultimately, our nation. 
         As you are aware, the non-teaching staff play a crucial role in the day-to-day operations of our institution, yet their children often face barriers to achieving educational success due to limited resources and opportunities. Our proposal seeks to address these challenges by offering targeted support such as tutoring, scholarships, access to educational materials, and mentorship programs. Through this initiative, we aim to create an equitable environment where every child has the opportunity to thrive, regardless of their socio-economic background. 

          We firmly believe that by investing in the education of these children, we are also investing in the future of our community. Educated individuals are more likely to contribute positively to society, pursue higher education, and become active participants in the workforce, driving both social and economic progress. This project is not only an expression of our commitment to social equity but also a strategic initiative that aligns with broader goals of national development. 
Enclosed with this letter is a detailed proposal outlining the objectives, methodology, expected outcomes, and budget for the project. We are confident that with the necessary support, this initiative will achieve its goals and have a profound impact on the lives of the children and families involved. 
We would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposal with you in further detail. Please do not hesitate to contact me at [phone number] or [email address] to arrange a meeting or if you require any additional information. 

Thank you for considering this proposal. We look forward to your positive response and the possibility of working together to make a meaningful difference in our community. Sincerely, 


 faithfully,
Ddamulira Aaron

  ABOUT THE CLUB
CLUB DESCRIPTION;
PEARL EDUCATION FUNDING ASSOCIATION [PEFA]
 The club is to help non-teaching staff with the main focus on education for their children through school fees payment and scholastic material distribution. This is to give a chance to the non-teaching staff children to access quality education. It is also to promote awareness on non-teaching staff; their value in schools and their rights. 


BACKGROUND INFORMATION
        Students most times tend to undermine the non-teaching staff yet in actual sense they play a very big role in their lives at school. They always take them for granted and don’t respect them. We believe that students in one way or another can give back to this staff.
      It is to our knowledge that children of non-teaching staff do not access education. With a clear theory that students in schools understand the value of education and importance of going to school. We believe that they can help their friends the children of non teaching staff who do not have that privillege to also access education. That is why pef decided to implement this club in schools.
      It has come to our notice that non teaching staff live miserable lives. They live under very poor conditions due to their low income earning and other issues that come with it like delayed pay and this affected them in providing for themselves and families. The money they get in most cases can not sustain most of their family and personal basic needs.
    with this, the children of non teaching staff have greatly been affected due to the child abuse and neglect that develops from this. Some parents since they can’t afford, they neglect their children from providing basic needs like education, clothing, medication and shelter among others.
       Domestic violence has peaked in the families of non teaching staff resulting into family breakdowns by child abandonment. These factors have pushed children into hush conditions like living on streets, joining immoral gangs in need to survivebut a clear death of their lives and futures. This has resulted into criminal engagement lifting levels of juvenile delinquency.
      Child abuse has been boosted. A lot of children have been sent into child labour to boost their families income leading to school dropouts since they can’t work and at the same time study with the factor that their parents can’t even afford it.
       It is also to increase on the number of beneficiaries of this programme since the club will be acting as a link between the non teaching staff and the organisation. This initiative is also  to engage students in the united nations sustainable development goals of zero hunger and quality education with no poverty to push our motherland into its struggle to a middle income status country.
      This will also guide students in analyzing and addressing problems of non-teaching staff through which they can explore career possibilities and use this knowledge in solving problems of other vulnerable groups in their community.
      By giving students a platform to bring on board unique innovative and creative ways/ideas of supporting non-teaching staff with main emphasis on education but not leaving aside other challenges they face enriching the spirit of generosity and community concern through improvising on their little available resources.

ORGANISATION AND CLUB FOUNDATION
